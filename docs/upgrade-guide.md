# Upgrade guide and release checklist

## POC 0.1.0

Initial demonstrator: .NET 10.0.12, Aspire 13.6, Vue 3, PostgreSQL 17 and Redis 8.6.
Production deployment now uses chiseled-extra images, immutable base digests, file-mounted
secrets, verified TLS, restricted DB roles/Redis ACL, static SPA serving and segmented Compose.
See [runbook](runbook.md) for the actual deployment procedure.

## Upgrade procedure

1. Review release/source changes, package/image advisories, licenses and SBOM; approve exact
   application/base digests. Keep Aspire SDK/hosting packages on the 13.6 release family.
2. Stop the exact AppHost before local builds. Run all test suites, production deployment
   checks and accessibility/manual regression appropriate to the change.
3. Back up the database, pepper, Data Protection key ring/certificate and nonsecret config.
   Rehearse restoring the backup in isolation; record RPO/RTO.
4. Review migrations for expand/contract compatibility. Drain gateway traffic; run the
   one-shot migration/role-grant job with **only** migrator credentials. Do not give DDL to apps.
5. Deploy digest-pinned API images; verify health, schema/version, queue drain, OIDC/CSRF,
   role scoping and a synthetic inference request. Preserve credentials/key encryption material.
6. Observe error/fallback rates and spend reconciliation. Record release, digests, schema,
   test evidence and approval in change management.

Schema-breaking changes require an explicit downtime/rollback plan. Image rollback is safe
only if the previous app supports the new schema. Do not automatically run destructive
down-migrations; restore an approved backup in isolation first. Redis counters reconstructed
after restart depend on committed usage and can lag in-flight requests.

## Certificate and secret rotation

Renew TLS certificates with appropriate SANs/CA, stage trust changes, restart the exact
services, verify strict validation. Rotate Redis ACL/client passwords together. Update
existing Postgres role passwords through an approved DBA workflow as well as secret files.
Keep old Data Protection decrypting certificates available during re-encryption/key-ring
transition; replacing the encryption certificate blindly loses provider credentials/cookies.
HMAC pepper rotation needs a designed key-hash migration or explicit replacement/revocation
of all virtual keys; the POC does not support transparent dual-pepper rotation.

## Dependency and supply-chain commands

```powershell
dotnet list UmeLlmGateway.slnx package --vulnerable --include-transitive
Set-Location src\admin-ui
npm audit --audit-level=low
Set-Location ..\..\tests\e2e
npm audit --audit-level=low
```

Generate an SPDX SBOM with the approved Microsoft `sbom-tool` version against each publish
directory; review package/image scans and provenance before promoting images. SBOM inputs
must exclude secret/certificate mounts, test results and developer environments. Dependency
audit success is time-bound, not proof of absence of vulnerabilities; container OS/package
scanning and signed artifact attestations remain municipal release responsibilities.
